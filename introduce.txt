It's my first time to use git

If this is your first time to create repository

The first step is 
    git init

The second step is
    git add .

The third step is 
    git commit -m "Second Time"

The forth step is 
    git remote add origin https://github.com/Createroner/test.git

The last step is 
    git push -u origin main



The second time to push

git remote add origin https://github.com/Createroner/test.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
